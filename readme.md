# E621 Downloader
# Versions: Python3 (done) | HTML (Planned)

This is reading all URLs from a file called posts and downloading them with wget I don't know if this works on Windows but if not open an issue and send me the command log and I will try to make a Windows version support Linux 64bit and macOS is 100%
